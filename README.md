# This is my emacs config.

Mostly tested with

 - emacs-mac on macOS v26+
 - vanilla emacs on Ubuntu v26+

Since this my personal config, no need to support anything older.

Other dependencies:

 - `Fira Mono`

 ```
 brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
 brew cast install font-fira-mono
 ```

npm stuff:

 - `prettier` for prettier-js-mode

Other stuff

```
